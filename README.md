# Hi, I’m Samat 

*Analytics Engineer | Data Infrastructure | AI-Enabled Analytics*  
Bay Area • SQL / Python • BigQuery / Snowflake • Airflow • Looker / Power BI

I build scalable analytics systems: clean data models, reliable pipelines, and decision-ready metrics.  
My background includes infrastructure analytics (Google/GCP), marketing attribution & ROI, and financial risk/churn analytics.  
Currently building *LucidParse* — an AI-assisted document intelligence pipeline (OCR → embeddings → structured extraction + validation).

---

## What I’m strong at
- *SQL at scale:* complex joins, window functions, query tuning, partitioning/clustering, 100M+ row datasets
- *Data modeling:* star schema, SCD2, metric layers, semantic consistency for BI
- *Pipelines:* Python + SQL ETL/ELT, orchestration patterns (Airflow-style), monitoring & validation
- *Analytics + product impact:* experimentation support, cohort/segmentation, KPI design, executive reporting
- *AI workflows (applied):* embeddings, retrieval patterns, evaluation/validation to reduce unreliable outputs

## Featured projects
### 1) LucidParse — AI Document Intelligence (In progress)
*Problem:* PDFs and scanned docs are hard to turn into reliable structured data  
*Solution:* OCR + chunking + embeddings + extraction + deterministic validation  
*Focus:* accuracy, latency, cost tradeoffs; confidence scoring and post-processing guardrails

### 2) GCP Infrastructure Audit & Inventory Analytics
*Problem:* fragmented infra signals, slow reporting, inconsistent definitions  
*Solution:* modeled warehouse tables + optimized queries + quality checks + dashboards  
*Impact:* improved data reliability and reduced time-to-insight (add metric)

### 3) Marketing Attribution & ROI Metrics Layer
*Problem:* multiple channels, inconsistent conversions, hard to measure ROI  
*Solution:* unified event model + attribution logic + performance-optimized reporting tables  
*Impact:* improved campaign reporting speed and decision-making (add metric)
