# Credit Risk & Churn Analytics Pipeline

## Overview
End-to-end analytics pipeline designed to support credit risk monitoring and customer churn analysis.  
The system transforms raw transactional and customer data into structured, validated datasets for KPI tracking, segmentation, and predictive modeling.

*Stack:* SQL (warehouse modeling), Python (ETL & validation), BigQuery/Snowflake (warehouse), BI layer  
*Scale:* Designed for high-volume transactional datasets (100M+ rows pattern)  
*Focus:* Repeatable pipelines, incremental loading, metric consistency, performance optimization

---

## Problem

Financial and lending analytics require:
- Consistent KPI definitions
- Reliable feature engineering
- Scalable data transformations
- Low-latency reporting
- Reduced manual reconciliation

Raw transactional data was fragmented and not structured for churn or risk analysis.

---

## Solution Architecture

### Data Flow

1. Raw transaction & customer tables
2. Staging transformations
3. Modeled warehouse layer (Star Schema)
4. Feature engineering layer
5. KPI & monitoring tables
6. BI / ML consumption

---

## Data Model

### Fact Tables
- fact_transactions
- fact_customer_activity
- fact_payments

### Dimension Tables
- dim_customer
- dim_product
- dim_time

*Grain:* One row per customer per day (for churn monitoring layer)

---

## Pipeline Design

### Incremental Strategy
- Partitioned by transaction_date
- Incremental merge using watermark logic
- Optimized clustering on customer_id

### Performance Optimization
- Reduced unnecessary joins
- Pre-aggregated heavy metrics
- Indexed/clustered on high-cardinality fields

### Data Quality
- Null validation checks
- Referential integrity checks
- Aggregation reconciliation tests
- Threshold-based anomaly flags

---

## Key Metrics

- Churn rate
- Delinquency rate
- Payment completion ratio
- Customer lifetime value (CLV)
- Risk exposure distribution

---

## Business Impact

- Standardized KPI definitions across reporting
- Reduced manual reconciliation effort
- Improved reporting performance via optimized transformations
- Enabled repeatable churn monitoring framework

---

## Future Improvements

- Add automated anomaly detection
- Integrate ML scoring layer
- Add monitoring dashboard for pipeline failures

---

## Performance Considerations

- Partitioned fact tables by transaction_date
- Clustered large tables on customer_id
- Pre-aggregated heavy metrics to reduce dashboard latency
- Reduced unnecessary joins in reporting layer
